 Hello World! This project uses Java Swing to create a text editor UI. I customized a JBUtton class 
 to have some more properties like mouse events, radius parameter to make it look a little better together with the windowsBuilder plugin.
 
>>I will be using this project to test out some other customization for the UI.
 
This text editor create using JAVA, will let you change the font, size, and color of your text!
You are able to save .txt files, change directories to save it
and search for .txt files and open them back here.

You can create new files from here too!

There are edit options to cut, copy and paste parts of your text.

 Enjoy!
